# tf_phonon_invert
Invert total scattering measurements for phonons

Software/Data stack:
The data Itotal.npy simulated using the ASE (Atomic Simulation Engine) https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/

Tensorflow (2.3)
At the moment forward model of phonons D(k) --> I(q)
inversion is attempted via backpropagation of one layer.
